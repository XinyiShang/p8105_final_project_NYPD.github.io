While examining the NYPD crime complaint data, we expect crime rate to be indicative by the socioeconomic status of a specific neighborhood. In this section, we calculated the crime rate for each neighborhood each year, and displayed the top neighborhoods with highest crime rate, along with what their crime composition looks like. We are also interested in whether crime rate can be predictive of rent in corresponding neighborhoods.

## Crime type

### What are the top 5 neighborhoods with highest average crime rate?
```{r}
ses_df |> group_by(borough, neighborhood) |>
  summarise(avg_crime_rate = mean(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  arrange(desc(avg_crime_rate)) |> head(5) |> knitr::kable()
```

### What are the top 5 neighborhoods with highest average crime rate?

```{r}
ses_df |> group_by(borough, neighborhood) |>
  summarise(avg_crime_rate = mean(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  arrange(desc(avg_crime_rate)) |> tail(5) |> knitr::kable()
```

Since CUMC is located in Manhattan, let's also visualize the crime rate in Manhattan:

```{r}
ses_df |> group_by(borough, neighborhood) |>
  filter(borough == "Manhattan") |> 
  summarise(avg_crime_rate = mean(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  arrange(desc(avg_crime_rate)) |> knitr::kable()
```

The top 5 neighborhoods of highest average crime rate are to our surprise, so we further looked into the common types of crimes in these neighorhoods. 

### What are the most common types of crime in these neighborhoods?

Chelsea/Clinton/Midtown:
```{r}
nypd_ses_df |> 
  filter(neighborhood =="Chelsea/Clinton/Midtown") |> 
  count(ofns_desc) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  head(5) |> 
  mutate(percentage = scales::percent(n / sum(n), scale = 100)) |> 
  select(ofns_desc, percentage) |> 
  rename(crime_type = ofns_desc) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

University Heights/Fordham: 
```{r}
nypd_ses_df |> 
  filter(neighborhood == "University Heights/Fordham") |> 
  count(ofns_desc) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  head(5) |> 
  mutate(percentage = scales::percent(n / sum(n), scale = 100)) |> 
  select(ofns_desc, percentage) |> 
  rename(crime_type = ofns_desc) |>
  knitr::kable() 
```

Mott Haven/Hunts Point: 
```{r}
nypd_ses_df |> 
  filter(neighborhood == "Mott Haven/Hunts Point") |> 
  count(ofns_desc) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  head(5) |> 
  mutate(percentage = scales::percent(n / sum(n), scale = 100)) |> 
  select(ofns_desc, percentage) |> 
  rename(crime_type = ofns_desc) |>
  knitr::kable() 
```

East Harlem:
```{r}
nypd_ses_df |> 
  filter(neighborhood == "East Harlem") |> 
  count(ofns_desc) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  head(5) |> 
  mutate(percentage = scales::percent(n / sum(n), scale = 100)) |> 
  select(ofns_desc, percentage) |> 
  rename(crime_type = ofns_desc) |>
  knitr::kable() 
```

Lower East Side/Chinatown: 
```{r}
nypd_ses_df |> 
  filter(neighborhood == "Lower East Side/Chinatown") |> 
  count(ofns_desc) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  head(5) |> 
  mutate(percentage = scales::percent(n / sum(n), scale = 100)) |> 
  select(ofns_desc, percentage) |>
  rename(crime_type = ofns_desc) |>
  knitr::kable() 
```

The high crime rate in Chelsea/Clinton/Midtown can be explained by the significant contribution of petite and grand larceny, which is as expected. 

Since CUMC is located in Washington Heights, let's take a closer look at the top 10 crime types at Washington Heights: 

```{r}
nypd_ses_df |> 
  filter(neighborhood == "Washington Heights/Inwood") |> 
  count(ofns_desc) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  head(10) |> 
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(ofns_desc, -percentage), y = percentage)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8)) + 
   labs(title = "Top 10 types of crime in Washington Heights/Inwood",
       x = "Percentage of all crimes",
       y = "Type of crimes") 
```


## Line plot

### Is there an association between rent and crime rate?

```{r}
ses_df |> group_by(neighborhood) |> 
  summarise(avg_rent_0_1beds = mean(gross_rent_0_1beds), 
            avg_rent_2_3beds = mean(gross_rent_2_3beds)
            , avg_crime_rate = mean(crime_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = avg_crime_rate)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = avg_rent_0_1beds, color = "Average Rent 0-1 Beds")) +
  geom_point(aes(y = avg_rent_2_3beds, color = "Average Rent 2-3 Beds")) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = avg_rent_0_1beds), method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "red") +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = avg_rent_2_3beds), method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "blue") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Average Rent 0-1 Beds" = "red", "Average Rent 2-3 Beds" = "blue")) +
  labs(title = "Point Plot of average rent against average crime rate",
       x = "Crime rate",
       y = "Average rent ($)") 
```

There appears to be no obvious association between rent and crime rate.

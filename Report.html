<div id="motivation" class="section level1">
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>As students living in NYC, we wanted to create a comprehensive
analysis of crime and safety in NYC. The goals of this project were to
use a NYPD data from 2006-2019 to provide a multi-dimensional view of
crime incidents in NYC. Particularly, we analyzed patterns of crime
events, characteristics of suspects &amp; victims, and socioeconomic
indicators. By doing so, we hoped to identify trends that may inform
better safety measures and law enforcement strategies.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level1">
<h1>Related Work</h1>
<p>A few things inspired this project. Firstly, we think our lived
experiences in NYC and wanting to engage with the city while still
remaining safe was a leading factor. From the increased prevalence of
cops on subways to news surrounding the spike in crimes in NYC
post-COVID-19, we thought that it was important to understand more
concretely what key factors contributed to crime and safety. Moreover, I
think another inspiration for this were the methods we learned in class
to visualize data in a variety of ways, including maps and geospatial
figures. We were eager to understand the differences by borough and
neighborhood, and tease apart nuances that may be lost when reading
headlines from the news.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level1">
<h1>Initial Questions</h1>
<p>Our intial plan for the data was to divide the large dataset into 3
key parts: general crime data, suspect and victim analysis, and
socioecnomic indicators. For the first section, we wanted to answer
questions like: “What are the total number of crimes by borough?” or “In
which borough are the most severe crimes occuring?” This was meant to be
a large overview of crime occuring in the city, particularly in its
prevalence and location. The second section sought to answer questions
such as “Do the types of suspects or perpetrators differ by borough?” or
“What group of people makes up the highest proportion of victims in
severe crime?” This gave us insight as to who is at risk, and where are
they at the highest risk. Finally, the last section was meant to answer
questions such as “Is income associated with crime rate?” In this
section we wanted to understand what were the contributing factors to
crime in NYC, and together with the previous sections, thought that this
multi-dimensional analysis could inform city safety improvements and law
enforcement policies.</p>
<p>While we were able to answer many of these questions and more, we
think it is important to note the source of our data. Coming from the
NYPD directly means that the data may be biased, and that individuals’
lived experiences with law enforcement and crime vary drastically from
demographic to demographic.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<div id="primary-data-source" class="section level3">
<h3>Primary Data Source</h3>
<p>Our main data source is NYPD historic complaint data. The raw data
includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to
NYPD from 2006 to 2022, and we filtered the data to only investigate
crime data between 2017 and 2022 to limit data size.</p>
<p>The original dataset is available at <a
href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i">NYPD
Complaint Data Historic</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, our filtered dataset is accessible through <a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kf2zk4t1onxzm2vo3lpkq/NYPD_Complaint_Data_Historic.csv?rlkey=ly36vi9v66sno80eir6rohlwn&amp;dl=1">Dropbox</a>.</p>

<div id="crime-event-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Crime Event Analysis</h3>
<div id="crime-count" class="section level4">
<h4>Crime Count</h4>
<p>To perform a comprehensive crime analysis, our initial step involves
examining the frequency of crime cases at the city, borough, and
neighborhood levels. Subsequently, we create visualizations depicting
the top 10 crime types in each borough over a span of 5 years to
illustrate distinct crime patterns. The key variables utilized in this
analysis include:<br />
* <code>cmplnt_fr_dt</code>: Date of the Crime<br />
* <code>boro_nm</code>: NYC borough name<br />
* <code>ofns_desc</code>: Crime Type<br />
* <code>neighborhood</code>: NYC neighborhood name<br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="offense-type" class="section level4">
<h4>Offense Type</h4>
<p>Given the offense description (<code>ofns_desc</code>), our dataset
comprises 69 distinct crime types. To ensure our visualizations remain
accessible and easily interpretable, we have condensed the scope to
encompass only the top 10 most prevalent crime types. Consequently, we
have curated a subset of the data, organized by the frequency of cases,
which consists of four key variables: * <code>ky_code</code>: A
numerical code representing the specific crime. * <code>count</code>:
The aggregate count of reported incidents for each crime. *
<code>ofns_desc</code>: The description of the crime type in textual
form. * <code>cumulative_percentage</code>: This denotes the running
total percentage of cases accounted for up to and including the current
row.</p>
<p>This streamlined dataset allows for a focused analysis of the crimes
that constitute the majority of cases, thereby rendering our visual
representations more concise and informative.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="suspects-and-victims" class="section level3">
<h3>Suspects and Victims</h3>
<p>A subset of the master dataset was created specifically for
demographic distribution analysis by selecting the relevant variables.
Rows with missing values were dropped for data cleaning purposes. Using
the cleaned subdatasets, we made barplots to visualize age, sex, race
distribution across boroughs and levels of offense. Columns with
incorrect data values are further cleaned up. The demographic dataset
has following variables:<br />
* <code>law_cat_cd</code>: level of crime<br />
* <code>boro_nm</code>: NYC borough name<br />
* <code>susp_age_group</code>: Age group the suspect belongs to (&lt;18,
18-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65+)<br />
* <code>susp_race</code>: Suspect race (AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE,
ASIAN / PACIFIC ISLANDER, BLACK, BLACK HISPANIC, WHITE, WHITE
HISPANIC)<br />
* <code>susp_sex</code>: Suspect sex (Female, Male)<br />
* <code>vic_age_group</code>: Age group the victim belongs to (&lt;18,
18-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65+)<br />
* <code>vic_race</code>: Victim race (AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE,
ASIAN / PACIFIC ISLANDER, BLACK, BLACK HISPANIC, WHITE, WHITE
HISPANIC)<br />
* <code>vic_sex</code>: Victim sex (Female, Male)</p>
</div>
<div id="crime-rate-and-socioeconomics-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Crime Rate and Socioeconomics analysis</h3>
<p>To conduct neighborhood-level analysis, we matched the police
precinct data from the NYPD complaint data to their specific
neighborhood according to <a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1584220/">Golub et
al. (2006)</a>. This allowed us to also match crime data and
socioeconomics data with the respective neighborhood.</p>
<p>For socioeconomic factor analysis, we utilized the <a
href="https://furmancenter.org/coredata/userguide/about">New York City
neighborhood indicator from the NYU Furman Center</a>, and we only
filtered for years between 2017 and 2022 as well as only kept the
variables of interest, such as percentage under poverty threshold,
median income, education, unemployment rate, race, and immigration
factors.</p>
<p>Using the total population data from this source, we were able to
calculate the crime rate per neighborhood: Crime Rate = (Total number of
complaints in a neighborhood in a given year / Total population in a
neighborhood in a given year) * 100,000. We also obtained precinct-level
<a
href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/2020-census-main.html">population
data from the 2020 Census</a> and calculated the incidence of serious
crimes (felony assault) in each precinct using the formula: (Total
number of complaints in a precinct in 2021) / (Total population in a
precinct in 2020) * 100,000. Additionally, we derived the serious crime
rate for each precinct (the number of felony assaults in each precinct
divided by the total number of complaints in each precinct). We merged
the socioeconomic data, spacial data by NYC Open Data, and crime rate by
neighborhood/precinct to conduct regression analyses.</p>
<p>The independent variables included in our models are as
follows:<br />
* <code>pop</code>: the population in each precinct (we used
<code>log(pop)</code> in the models)<br />
* <code>hh_inc_med_adj</code>: the median household’s total income of
all members of the household aged 15 years or older<br />
* <code>pop16_unemp_pct</code>: the number of people aged 16 years and
older in the civilian labor force who are unemployed, divided by the
total number of people aged 16 years and older in the civilian labor
force<br />
* <code>pop_edu_collp_pct</code>: the percentage of the population aged
25 and older who have attained a bachelor’s degree or higher<br />
* <code>pop_pov_pct</code>: the number of people below the poverty
threshold divided by the number of people for whom poverty status was
determined<br />
* <code>pop_race_asian_pct</code>: the percentage of the total
population that identifies as Asian (non-Hispanic)<br />
* <code>pop_race_black_pct</code>: the percentage of the total
population that identifies as black (non-Hispanic)<br />
* <code>pop_race_white_pct</code>: the percentage of the total
population that identifies as white (non-Hispanic)<br />
* <code>pop_race_hisp_pct</code>: the percentage of the total population
that identifies as Hispanic (of any race)<br />
* <code>pop_foreign_pct</code>: the share of the population that is born
outside the United States or Puerto Rico</p>
</div>
<div id="data-quality-issues" class="section level3">
<h3>Data quality issues</h3>
<p>We noticed that there are missing SES data for the year 2020 and
2022; therefore, our regression analyses are based on the data in 2017,
2018, 2019, and 2021. The only precinct-level population data available
from the census was for the year 2020. Furthermore, the dataset contains
missing values, indicated by “(null),” which were excluded from the
analysis during the filtering process.</p>

<h3>Crime Event Analysis</h3>
<p>*Temporal Trends: To depict the trends in the number of cases over
each year, three visual representations were generated: a line plot for
New York City at the aggregate level, another line plot for individual
boroughs, and a bar plot for neighborhood-level analysis. In the New
York City level, there is a subtle decreasing trend observed from 2017
to 2019, followed by a significant drop in the number of cases in
2020.Post-2020, a noteworthy and rapid increase in the number of cases
is evident, surpassing the figures recorded in any previous years.<br />
To highlight the variations in law categories across each year and
borough, a line graph was produced.<br />
For showcasing the top 10 types of crime annually within each borough,
an interactive Shiny app was developed. This app facilitates the display
of bar plots illustrating the top 10 crime types in each borough for
every year.<br />
To illustrate the trends over time, a barplot was designed to showcase
the frequency of various crime types across different years. To analyze
daily temporal patterns, a line graph was created to delve into the
patterns within different times of the day, with each line tracing the
fluctuations in crime counts throughout the hours, thereby emphasizing
the periods when crime peaks are most prevalent.</p>
<p>*Spatial Distribution: An interactive map was developed to illustrate
the spread and density of different crime types throughout the boroughs
of New York City. This map allows users to interactively explore crime
data across regions by selecting year and crime type, offering insights
into the geographical crime landscape</p>
</div>
<div id="suspects-and-victims-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Suspects and Victims</h3>
<p><img src="demographic_analysis.png" /></p>
<p>Six barplots were created to visualize the distribution of race, age,
and sex in suspects and victims against boroughs and levels of crime.
The legends are labeled in the first two plots and are consistent
throughout the rest.<br />
F or analysis across boroughs, number of suspects and number of victims
are separately counted in each race, age, and sex groups. Initially,
count of suspects and victims in each race, age, and sex groups were
plotted. However, the different total population of each borough made it
difficult to directly visualize the distributions. Thus, percentage of
suspects and victims in each race, age, and sex groups were calculated
by dividing the count by total number of suspects or victims in each
borough. For analysis across levels of crime, the data is divided into
victims and suspects. Variables describing race, age, and sex were
selected. The absolute counts are plotted out against each levels of
crime.</p>

<h3>Crime rate and socioeconomic status by neighborhood/NYPD
precinct</h3>
<p>Together with the SES indicator data, we calculated the average crime
rate (2017 - 2022) for each neighborhood. We displayed tables showing
the 5 neighborhoods with highest and lowest crime rate.</p>
<p>Top 5 neighborhoods with highest crime rate:</p>

<p>In addition, we showed the most common types of crimes in the 5
neighborhoods with highest crime rate. Since our CUMC campus is located
in Washington Heights, we also showed the top 10 types of crime in our

<h3>Socioeconomics factors and crime rate</h3>
<p>We applied a MLR model and spatial regression models to investigate
potential socioeconomics factors that are associated with crime rate,
including percentage of population below poverty line, median household
income, education, unemployment, race, and immigration status. Our
analysis consists of two parts, focusing on the overall crime rate and
the serious crime rate.</p>
<p>For the overall crime rate, using a backward elimination approach, we
first visualized the association between crime rate and 4 important
factors that we hypothesized may be relevant:</p>
<p><img src="Crime_Rate_Analysis_files/combined_eda_plot.png" /></p>
<p>Then, we shortlisted percentage of population below poverty line and
median household income as the main predictors of crime rate. We also
ran a diagnostics analysis of this model, confirming low
multicollinearity between the two predictors, and confirmed that
residuals are around 0. Our final model is as follow:</p>
<p><img src="Crime_Rate_Analysis_files/final_MLR.png" /></p>
<p>We investigated the felony crime rate using three models (standard
linear regression, spatial lag model, and spatial error model) and
compared their performance. To detect spatial autocorrelation, we
visualized the serious crime rate and their linear regression residuals
at the precinct level. The Moran scatter plot and the Moran I test were
employed for a more in-depth assessment of spatial autocorrelation.
Diagnostic checks were conducted on the linear model to ensure that
assumptions were met. Ultimately, we compared the three models by
examining Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values.</p>

<h4>Crime Count</h4>
<p>From 2017 to 2019, a subtle decrease in reported cases occurred,
followed by a significant drop in 2020, possibly due to the COVID-19
pandemic and related factors. Post-2020 saw a rapid increase in cases,
surpassing previous years.</p>
<p>Brooklyn consistently led in reported crimes from 2017 to 2022,
followed by Manhattan; Staten Island consistently reported the lowest
cases. Notably, Queens overtook the Bronx in reported cases in 2021.</p>
<p>North Crown Heights/Prospect Heights consistently reported the fewest
cases, while Morningside Heights/Hamilton Heights consistently had the
highest, except in 2020 when East Harlem topped. The top three
neighborhoods overall are Morningside Heights/Hamilton Heights, East
Harlem, and Chelsea/Clinton/Midtown.</p>
<p><img src="CrimeCount_Figure.jpg" /></p>
<p>In Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, misdemeanors were most
common, followed by felonies, with violations least common, except for
Staten Island, where felony and violation cases are more balanced.</p>
<p>Staten Island’s lower case count is likely due to its smaller
population. Cases in Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens show
consistency, with felonies increasing each year (except 2020),
misdemeanors declining from 2017 to 2020 and then rising, while
violation cases remain relatively constant.</p>
<p>PETIT LARCENY tops the list of reported crimes in New York City,
followed closely by HARASSMENT 2 and ASSAULT 3 &amp; related offenses.
These patterns persist across boroughs, with Manhattan showing a
distinctive focus on GRAND LARCENY, and STATEN ISLAND exhibiting a shift
to CRIMINAL MISCHIEF &amp; RELATED OFFENSES as the third most reported
crime. In the BRONX, HARRASSMENT 2 surpasses PETIT LARCENY in reported
cases. Recognizing these trends can inform targeted crime prevention
strategies tailored to each borough’s specific needs, emphasizing the
prevalence of theft in Manhattan and consistent concerns about
harassment and assault citywide.</p>
</div>
<div id="offense-type-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Offense Type</h4>
<p>The top 10 most frequent crime types constitute a substantial 80.5%
of all crime cases reported to the NYPD from 2017 through 2022,
revealing a concentrated pattern of offenses. Within this dataset,
‘Petit Larceny’ stands out for its relative stability year over year,
consistently forming a significant segment of the reported offenses.</p>
<p>Examining the daily temporal pattern, we observe pronounced peaks for
offenses such as petit larceny, harassment 2, and grand larceny during
the hours from 11 AM to 6 PM. This trend likely correlates with
increased daytime activity when the streets are bustling, and the
opportunity for these crimes escalates. The timing of these peaks
coincides with the busiest periods in public spaces, suggesting a
potential link between crime frequency and population density.</p>
<p>Conversely, all offenses demonstrate a substantial decrease in
frequency around the early hours of 5 AM and 6 AM. This trough in
criminal activity can be attributed to the minimal pedestrian and
vehicle traffic at these times, along with a general reduction in social
interactions as most individuals are home, thus lowering the risk and
opportunity for offenses.</p>
<p>These temporal insights are invaluable for stakeholders such as law
enforcement agencies and community leaders, who could leverage this data
to optimize resource allocation, aiming for effective crime prevention
and timely response. Furthermore, this analysis can trigger deeper
inquiries into the causal factors behind the peak times for specific
offenses, guiding the development of targeted crime prevention
strategies and interventions. Understanding the rhythm of criminal
activity empowers decision-makers to adopt a more strategic approach in
combating crime and enhancing community safety.</p>
<p>Our interactive map highlights that Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx
are areas with higher crime rates. This could be due to various factors
like population density, socio-economic conditions, or policing
strategies. Neighborhood Variations: An interesting observation is that
the Upper East Side in Manhattan has significantly lower crime rates
compared to its neighboring areas. This could be attributed to factors
like higher income levels, better security measures, or lower population
density.</p>

<h3>Suspects and Victims</h3>
<p>It is interesting to see the distribution of race are quite similar
between suspects and victims. This suggests that the racial composition
of individuals involved as suspects or victims is consistent across the
dataset. The distribution of race are also similar between boroughs.
This suggests that there is no significant variation in the racial
demographics of incidents across different boroughs. The distribution of
age group are also similar between suspects and victims, as well as
across boroughs. This implies consistency in age demographics across
dataset and NYC boroughs. In combined, we observe consistency in the
race and age group distribution in suspects and victims in NYC crimes.
The distributions are uniform throughout the city, which was not
expected. The uniformity in demographic patterns may indicate systemic
factors influencing incidents rather than borough-specific or
role-specific(suspect vs victim) factors.<br />
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the distribution of sex in suspects and victims
show significantly more male suspects than female suspects across all 7
NYC boroughs. This suggests a consistent gender disparity among
individuals identified as suspects. Additionally, there are
significantly more female victims than male victims across all 7 NYC
boroughs. In combined, the data highlights a gender imbalance with a
higher proportion of males being identified as suspects and a higher
proportion of females being victims. The gender distribution is not
surprising and confirms what we expected. The observed gender
disparities may suggests potential sociological or systemic factors
influencing crime reporting, law enforcement, or victimization.<br />
</p>
<p>In the barplot of race distribution across different levels of
offense, we can see that black individuals have the highest counts
across all crimes for both suspects and victims. In both charts, white
Hispanic individuals make up the 2nd highest count, and then white
individuals make up the 3rd. For suspects, black Hispanic individuals
make up the 4th highest count, but Asian/Pacific Islander make up the
4th highest count of victims.<br />
</p>
<p>In the chart of age distribution across different levels of offense,
we see that the 25-44 age group is the most populous for both suspects
and victims across all levels of crime. Interestingly, the 18-24 group
is the 2nd greatest for felony suspects, the 45-64 group is the 2nd
highest for violation suspects, and both are relatively equal for
misdemeanor suspects. Among the victims, 45-64 are consistently the 2nd
highest, with 18-24 following them.<br />
</p>
<p>In the chart of sex distribution across different levels of offense,
we see that women make up a greater number of victims, while men make up
a greater number of suspects. However, the disparity between sexes is
smaller among the victims than it is among the suspects.<br />
</p>
<p>Throughout our public health education, we have learned about the
importance of intersectionality. While these snapshots give us
information about key demographic identities, we may be missing some
kind of bigger picture. So, now we will investigate which combinations
of identities are the most prevalent among the suspects and victims.</p>
</div>
<div id="socioeconomics-factors-and-crime-rate-1"
class="section level3">
<h3>Socioeconomics factors and crime rate</h3>
<p>It was to our surprise that the Chelsea/Clinton/Midtown neighborhood
has the highest average crime rate/serious crime rate, but this is
subsequently explained by a great percentage of petite and grand
larceny. Additionally, this neighborhood has a much larger daytime fluid
population than residents, so the low numerator population in contrast
to the high absolute number of crimes may contribute to the
extraordinarily high crime rate compared to the rest of the area. In
areas of highest crime rate, larceny, harassment, assault, and criminal
mischief are the most common types of crime.</p>
<p>For the regression analysis investigating crime rate as an outcome,
it is aligned with our hypothesis that percentage of population below
poverty line and median household income are the two main significant
factors associated with crime rate. We originally expected high
collinearity between these two factors, but the VIF analysis did not
show such evidence.</p>
<p>This model is subject to several limitations. Firstly, the use of
neighborhood-level data assumes homogeneity among all individuals within
a neighborhood regarding the averaged predictors. However, the data at
hand lacks the capacity to account for significant variability within
neighborhoods. Secondly, a potential spatial autocorrelation issue
arises. Crime levels in each neighborhood may exhibit spatial
correlation, challenging the assumption of independence in standard
logistic regression.</p>
<p>To address the spatial autocorrelation issue and to further
investigate the serious crime rate in each precinct, we employed spatial
regression models. Our analysis revealed that the spatial error model
(SEM) had the best fit. Despite the absence of global spatial
autocorrelation in the linear regression residuals (insignificant
results from global Moran I for regression residuals), the SEM model
exhibited superior performance compared to the other two models. This
may be attributed to potential local spatial patterns of heterogeneity
that were captured by the spatial error model. The coefficients of
poverty rate was found to be significant in this model, as well as the
percentage of Asian, White, and immigration population in each precinct.
Surprisingly, no association were detected between the serious crime
rate and the median household’s income, higher education level, and
unemployment rate.</p>
<p><img src="lin_sp.png" /></p>
<p>Crime patterns in urban settings are complex and shaped by local
dynamics. Factors such as population density, land use, and historical
context can influence crime rates in some neighborhoods. The coexistence
of both high-income and low-income households in a single precinct can
also complicate an overall understanding of the dynamics between
socioeconomic factors and crime rates. Therefore, further analysis is
needed to delve deeper into these complexities and gain a more nuanced
understanding of the factors that influence crime patterns in New York
City.</p>

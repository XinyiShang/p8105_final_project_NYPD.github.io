p8105 final project NYPD

## Overview
This repository contains the data and code for the website "The Revealed Reality," which analyzes NYPD complaint data to explore safety in New York City. The project spans 2006-2019 and delves into crime events, suspect/victim correlations, and the relationship between crime and socioeconomic status.

## Data Source

Our primary data source is the NYPD Historic Complaint Data. The original dataset is available at [NYPD Complaint Data Historic](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i). 

Additionally, our processed and filtered dataset is accessible through [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kf2zk4t1onxzm2vo3lpkq/NYPD_Complaint_Data_Historic.csv?rlkey=ly36vi9v66sno80eir6rohlwn&dl=1).

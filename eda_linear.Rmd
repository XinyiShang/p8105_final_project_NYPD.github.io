This analysis focuses on the proportion of serious crimes ("felony assault") and aims to investigate the socioeconomic factors associated with the higher rate of serious crimes. Again, we used 2021 NYPD crime complaint data and 2020 Census population data.   
The primary outcome (dependent variable: `fel_asslt_rate`) is the number of felony assault cases in each precinct divided by the total number of complaints in each precinct.  
NYC Open Data (2013) was used as spatial data to determine the borders of each precinct.

We built the following three models and compered their performance.   
- **Standard linear regression**  
- **Spatial lag model (SLM)**  
- **Spatial error model (SEM)**   

```{r}
# simple linear regression
fit.ols.simple = lm(fel_asslt_rate ~ hh_inc_med_adj, data = count_by_precinct)

# multiple linear regression
fit.ols.multiple = lm(fel_asslt_rate ~ log(pop) + hh_inc_med_adj + pop16_unemp_pct + pop_edu_collp_pct + pop_pov_pct + pop_race_asian_pct + pop_race_black_pct + pop_race_white_pct + pop_race_hisp_pct + pop_foreign_pct, data = count_by_precinct)

# the neighbor nb object using poly2nb()
seab = poly2nb(count_by_precinct, queen = T)

# the listw weights object using nb2listw()
seaw = nb2listw(seab, style = "W", zero.policy = TRUE)

# Spatial lag model (SLM)
fit.lag = lagsarlm(fel_asslt_rate ~ log(pop) + hh_inc_med_adj + pop16_unemp_pct + pop_edu_collp_pct + pop_pov_pct + pop_race_asian_pct + pop_race_black_pct + pop_race_white_pct + pop_race_hisp_pct + pop_foreign_pct, data = count_by_precinct, listw = seaw) 

# get estimates of the direct, indirect and total effect of each variable
fit.lag.effects = impacts(fit.lag, listw = seaw, R = 999)

# Spatial error model (SEM)
fit.err = errorsarlm(fel_asslt_rate ~ log(pop) + hh_inc_med_adj + pop16_unemp_pct + pop_edu_collp_pct + pop_pov_pct + pop_race_asian_pct + pop_race_black_pct + pop_race_white_pct + pop_race_hisp_pct + pop_foreign_pct, data = count_by_precinct, listw = seaw) 
```

First, let's look at the histogram of the dependent variable. The distribution is unimodal and slightly right-skewed, but overall it is approximately normally distributed.
```{r}
# histogram
count_by_precinct |> 
  ggplot() +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = fel_asslt_rate)) +
    xlab("Felony assault rate")
```

# Explaratory spatial data analysis  
```{r}
# ESDA
tmap_mode("plot")

tm_shape(count_by_precinct, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "fel_asslt_rate", style = "quantile", palette = "Reds", title = "") +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 2, 4), text.size = 1, position = c("right", "bottom")) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Felony assault rate, 2021",  main.title.size = 0.95, frame = FALSE, legend.outside = TRUE, 
            attr.outside = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# plot residuals
count_by_precinct = count_by_precinct |> 
  mutate(olsresid = resid(fit.ols.multiple))

tm_shape(count_by_precinct, unit = "mi") +
  tm_polygons(col = "olsresid", style = "quantile",palette = "Reds", title = "") +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 2, 4), text.size = 1, position = c("right", "bottom")) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Residuals from linear regression",  main.title.size = 0.95, frame = FALSE, legend.outside = TRUE,
            attr.outside = TRUE)
```

The spatial distribution of precincts with high felony crime rates and the residuals of the linear regression model are visualized. Spatial autocorrelation of errors is indicated as both maps appear to cluster.

```{r}
# examine the Moran scatterplot
moran.plot(as.numeric(scale(count_by_precinct$fel_asslt_rate)), listw = seaw, 
           xlab = "Standardized Felony Assault Rate", 
           ylab = "Precincts Standardized Felony Assault Rate",
           main = c("Moran Scatterplot for Felony assault rate in NYC"))
```

The Moran scatter plot displays the positive relationship between the standardized felony assault rate and precincts standardized felony assault rate. 

```{r}
# the Global Moranâ€™s I
# use Monte Carlo simulation to get the p-value
moran.mc(count_by_precinct$fel_asslt_rate, seaw, nsim=999) |> 
  broom::tidy() |> 
  knitr::kable()

# repeat for the OLS residuals using the lm.morantest() function
lm.morantest(fit.ols.multiple, seaw) |> 
  broom::tidy() |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

The Moran I test indicates that there is a positive spatial autocorrelation for the felony assault rate, but no spatial autocorrelation for the linear regression residuals.

# Compare three models 

```{r results = "asis"}
# present results for more than one model
stargazer(fit.ols.multiple, fit.lag, fit.err, type = "html", digits = 3, title = "Regression Results")
```

```{r}
# save AIC values
AICs = c(AIC(fit.ols.multiple),AIC(fit.lag), AIC(fit.err))
labels = c("Standard Linear Regression", "Spatial Lag Model","Spatial Error Model" )

data.frame(Models = labels, AIC = round(AICs, 2)) |> 
  knitr::kable() 
```
The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values across the three models suggest that the spatial error model (SEM) is the best fit of the three models. 

The coefficients of `pop_pov_pct`, `pop_race_asian_pct`, `pop_race_white_pct` and `pop_foreign_pct` were statistically significant in the spatial error model.  

## Linear regression diagnostics
```{r}
# diagnostics
ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x=resid(fit.ols.multiple))) +
  xlab("OLS residuals")

qqPlot(fit.ols.multiple)

plot(resid(fit.ols.multiple))
```

OLS residuals are normally distributed and Q-Q plot also indicates that the normality assumption is met in this model. There may be heteroskedasticity according to the third plot, where the points are narrowing as the index moves from left to right.

# Conclusion
The spatial error model demonstrated a superior fit, revealing that factors such as the poverty rate, the percentage of Asian and White populations, and the percentage of individuals born outside the US or Puerto Rico were significant predictors for serious crime rates.

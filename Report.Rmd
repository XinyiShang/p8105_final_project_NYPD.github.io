# Motivation
  As students living in NYC, we wanted to create a comprehensive analysis of crime and safety in NYC. The goals of this project were to use a NYPD data from 2006-2019 to provide a multi-dimensional view of crime incidents in NYC. Particularly, we analyzed patterns of crime events, characteristics of suspects & victims, and socioeconomic indicators. By doing so, we hoped to identify trends that may inform better safety measures and law enforcement strategies.  

# Related Work
  A few things inspired this project. Firstly, we think our lived experiences in NYC and wanting to engage with the city while still remaining safe was a leading factor. From the increased prevalence of cops on subways to news surrounding the spike in crimes in NYC post-COVID-19, we thought that it was important to understand more concretely what key factors contributed to crime and safety. Moreover, I think another inspiration for this were the methods we learned in class to visualize data in a variety of ways, including maps and geospatial figures. We were eager to understand the differences by borough and neighborhood, and tease apart nuances that may be lost when reading headlines from the news. 

# Initial Questions 
  Our intial plan for the data was to divide the large dataset into 3 key parts: general crime data, suspect and victim analysis, and socioecnomic indicators. For the first section, we wanted to answer questions like: "What are the total number of crimes by borough?" or "In which borough are the most severe crimes occuring?" This was meant to be a large overview of crime occuring in the city, particularly in its prevalence and location. The second section sought to answer questions such as "Do the types of suspects or perpetrators differ by borough?" or "What group of people makes up the highest proportion of victims in severe crime?" This gave us insight as to who is at risk, and where are they at the highest risk. Finally, the last section was meant to answer questions such as "Is income associated with crime rate?" In this section we wanted to understand what were the contributing factors to crime in NYC, and together with the previous sections, thought that this multi-dimensional analysis could inform city safety improvements and law enforcement policies. 
  While we were able to answer many of these questions and more, we think it is important to note the source of our data. Coming from the NYPD directly means that the data may be biased, and that individuals' lived experiences with law enforcement and crime vary drastically from demographic to demographic. 

# Data (Source scraping method cleaning)

### Primary Data Source
  Our main data source is NYPD historic complaint data. The raw data includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to NYPD from 2006 to 2022, and we filtered the data to only investigate crime data between 2017 and 2022 to limit data size. 
  
### Suspects and Victims

  A subset of the master dataset was created specifically for demographic distribution analysis by selecting the relevant variables. Rows with missing values were dropped for data cleaning purpose. The demographic dataset is further divided into suspects and victims datasets to calculate the percentage of race, age and sex. Columns with incorrect data values are further cleaned up. The demographic dataset has following variables:
   * `boro_nm`: NYC borough name\
   * `susp_age_group`: Age group the suspect belongs to (<18, 18-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65+)\
   * `susp_race`: Suspect race (AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE, ASIAN / PACIFIC ISLANDER, BLACK, BLACK HISPANIC, WHITE, WHITE HISPANIC)\
   * `susp_sex`: Suspect sex (Female, Male)\
   * `vic_age_group`: Age group the victim belongs to (<18, 18-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65+)\
   * `vic_race`: Victim race (AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE, ASIAN / PACIFIC ISLANDER, BLACK, BLACK HISPANIC, WHITE, WHITE HISPANIC)\
   * `vic_sex`: Victim sex (Female, Male)
   
### Crime Rate and Socioeconomics analysis

  To conduct neighborhood-level analysis, we matched the police precinct data from the NYPD complaint data to their specific neighborhood according to Golub et al. (2006). This allowed us to also match crime data and socioeconomics data with the respective neighborhood.
  
  For socioeconomic factor analysis, we utilized the New York City neighborhood indicator from the NYU Furman Center, and we only filtered for years between 2017 and 2022 as well as only kept the variables of interest, such as percentage under poverty threshold, median income, education, unemployment rate, race, and immigration factors. Using the total population data from this source, we were able to calculate the crime rate per neighborhood: Crime Rate = (Total number of complaints in a neighborhood in a given year / Total population in a neighborhood in a given year) * 100,000. We merged the socioeconomic data and crime rate by neighborhood to conduct regression analyses. 
  
### Data quality issues

  We noticed that there are missing SES data for the year 2020 and 2022; therefore, our regression analyses are based on the data in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021. 
  


# Exploratory analysis
(Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analysies. Justify the steps you took, and show any major change to your ideas)

### Suspects and Victims

Three barplots were created to visualize the distribution of race, age, and sex in suspects and victims. Number of suspects and number of victims are separately counted in each race, age, and sex groups. Initially, count of suspects and victims in each race, age, and sex groups were plotted. However, the different total population of each borough made it difficult to directly visualize the distributions. Thus, percentage of suspects and victims in each race, age, and sex groups were calculated by dividing the count by total number of suspects or victims in each borough.

### Crime rate by neighborhood 

  Together with the SES indicator data, we calculated the average crime rate (2017 - 2022) for each neighborhood. We displayed tables showing the 5 neighborhoods with highest and lowest crime rate, along with the most common types of crimes in the 5 neighborhoods with highest crime rate. Since our CUMC campus is located in Washington Heights, we also showed the top 10 types of crime in our neighborhood. 

# Regression Analysis

### Socioeconomics factors and crime rate

We applied a MLR model to investigate potential socioeconomics factors that are associated with crime rate, including percentage of population below poverty line, median household income, education, unemployment, race, and immigration status. Using a backward elimination approach, we shortlisted percentage of population below poverty line and median household income as the main predictors of crime rate. We also ran a diagnostics analysis of this model, confirming low multicollinearity between the two predictors, and confirmed that residuals are around 0. 

# Discussion 
### Suspects and Victims 
 It is interesting to see the distribution of race are quite similar between suspects and victims. This suggests that the racial composition of individuals involved as suspects or victims is consistent across the dataset. The distribution of race are also similar between boroughs. This suggests that there is no significant variation in the racial demographics of incidents across different boroughs. The distribution of age group are also similar between suspects and victims, as well as across boroughs. This implies consistency in age demographics across dataset and NYC boroughs. In combined, we observe consistency in the race and age group distribution in suspects and victims in NYC crimes. The distributions are uniform throughout the city, which was not expected. The uniformity in demographic patterns may indicate systemic factors influencing incidents rather than borough-specific or role-specific(suspect vs victim) factors. \
  
  On the other hand, the distribution of sex in suspects and victims show significantly more male suspects than female suspects across all 7 NYC boroughs. This suggests a consistent gender disparity among individuals identified as suspects. Additionally, there are significantly more female victims than male victims across all 7 NYC boroughs. In combined, the data highlights a gender imbalance with a higher proportion of males being identified as suspects and a higher proportion of females being victims. The gender distribution is not surprising and confirms what we expected. The observed gender disparities may suggests potential sociological or systemic factors influencing crime reporting, law enforcement, or victimization. 
  
### Socioeconomics factors and crime rate

  It was to our surprise that the Chelsea/Clinton/Midtown neighborhood has the highest average crime rate, but this is subsequently explained by a great percentage of petite and grand larceny. In areas of highest crime rate, larceny, harassment, assault, and criminal mischief are the most common types of crime. 
  
  For the regression analysis investigating crime rate as an outcome, it is aligned with our hypothesis that percentage of population below poverty line and median household income are the two main significant factors associated with crime rate. We originally expected high collinearity between these two factors, but the VIF analysis did not show such evidence.
